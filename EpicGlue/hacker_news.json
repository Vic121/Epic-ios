But I\u0026#x27;m afraid I won\u0026#x27;t be able to find something really challenging and interesting like things I would work on at full-time job in some SV tech startup. By interesting and challenging I mean something with performance challenges, huge amounts of data, distributed systems, scaling and stuff.\u003cp\u003eAm I right and I should better look for a full time job? Or am I just don\u0026#x27;t know how and where to find freelance projects?",

      "description": "I don\u0026#x27;t quite know how to ask this, so bear with me. I feel like there\u0026#x27;s a large gap, a lack of direction between the common advice - DRY, KISS, design patterns, clean code, etc. - and understanding how to tackle actual architecture problems.\u003cp\u003eOn the small team I work on, we have various problems that are affecting our ability to maintain and extend our code, and, more importantly, hindering our ability to scale.\u003cp\u003eAn example: We\u0026#x27;ve been using MySQL basically as a data processing platform for transforming data overnight (and storing it transformed in separate tables), so we can do even more aggregation for requests during business hours, albeit more efficiently; I want to be able to simplify the role of the database, move the processing logic up, and get away from long overnight jobs. However, we lose the benefit of having our pre-processed data resting in the database waiting to be aggregated at a moment\u0026#x27;s notice; doing both the processing then aggregation on the fly would be far too expensive. How do I research how to deal with that?\u003cp\u003eThis also extends to architecting our code. The front-end especially is rough, the usual story of pent up technical debt. Our web interface has gotten more and more complicated, and while we can get very far by just revisiting it with experienced eyes, there\u0026#x27;s still glaring problems with complex interactions of components.\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#x27;m pushing (and succeeding) at moving towards efforts to clean up the mess that has accumulated (maybe even a whole rewrite, woo!), but I want to be able to really pull my weight and contribute to the process. I\u0026#x27;m a recent graduate, and my design experience is relatively limited, but considering the number of resources available to me to learn how to become a better _developer_, I\u0026#x27;m missing what\u0026#x27;s available to become a better _architect_ (beyond the usual \u0026quot;it comes with time\u0026quot;).

      "description": "I was raised in Germany, live next to Frankfurt. My wife and I decided to set up our incorporated consultancy company here. What we are going through might not be the same for you, but it could be similar.\nFirst: be warned. If you want to serve Europe, think twice if you absolutely need to have a German presence.\nIt\u0026#x27;s been 9 months now that we are working to set up a functional company. \n1.) It took about 3 months until the company registration went through. You have to spend a few hundred Euro at a notary to register it.\n2.) Renting office space was the only quick and easy thing\n3.) It took 4 months until we got connected to the internet. Telekom cancelled the contract because \u0026quot;all lines are full and we can\u0026#x27;t connect you\u0026quot;. I heard about \u0026quot;no connection available\u0026quot; several times from others. O2 didn\u0026#x27;t cancel our contract, but was ready to wait for 4 months until they could lease a line from Telekom.\n4.) That doesn\u0026#x27;t mean that we have Internet now. The specialized router was sent by DHL, which is on strike indefinitely.\n5.) Since the beginning of 2014, strikes are a major problem in this country when travelling. Lufthansa and the Deutsche Bahn (trains) are guaranteed to strike when you need them most. Be aware that instead of your fast connection to Berlin from Frankfurt, you end up spending hours in busses to get to the destination. Last year, getting to my main client was a weekly struggle as I could not always go by car.\n6.) To be able to write invoices, you need a tax number. After 5 months of waiting (wait time after we officially set up business in our Town, after the official registration of the company itself) the financial authorities finally sent us the questionnaire (after asking 2 times) that will eventually lead to a tax number (I guess one more month). However, this is only the German tax number. If you want to do business with the rest of the EU, you need a VAT-ID which will take another month after we got our national number.",

      "description": "A few months ago I decided to begin moonlighting as a consultant. I put up a website (https:\u0026#x2F;\u0026#x2F;www.parkandeaton.com), started a twitter\u0026#x2F;facebook account, started a high-level technical blog, started a Meetup, started attending Meetups, and handing out my business cards to business owners who will take them.\u003cp\u003eI am interested in two things typically: security and usability auditing for smaller companies who don\u0026#x27;t have the staff or knowledge to do this themselves. I am also interested in optimizing the run-way for small companies who have no technical run-way (using docker, vagrant, etc.)\u003cp\u003eSo, to appeal to small companies, I keep a high-level blog and post links to the stuff on twitter and facebook. This generates little to no attention.\u003cp\u003eIn my experience, there are tons of companies who \u0026#x2F;need\u0026#x2F; security\u0026#x2F;usability auditing but I don\u0026#x27;t know how to reach them. There are also tons of small companies who could use run-way optimization but I don\u0026#x27;t know how to reach them. Letting them know they need something has just resulted in defensive attitudes. So I can\u0026#x27;t figure out how to show my usefulness without forcing someone into (what they feel is) a corner.\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#x27;ve ever tried marketing your services to small businesses who tend not to even be aware they \u0026#x2F;need\u0026#x2F; your services, what have you done? How can I get my blog (which is geared toward very high-level technical tips) more traction among a crowd who isn\u0026#x27;t necessarily looking for technical information? And ultimately, how do I get my first clients (who are not looking for a new Wordpress site)?",

      "description": "Hi NH.\u003cp\u003eA couple of years ago I realised I was a mediocre programmer. After 5 years of work experience with unfinished degree I knew only one language (php of all...) and some good practices on a surface level. I set that for change. For 2 years I studied in my spare time, learned a bit of Java, go, clojure, learned some fundamentals and good practices classics (gang of four, DRY) started reading blogs and following the industry.\u003cp\u003eExcept, it\u0026#x27;s too much. I realised I am into too many things. I know a bit of everything, but not too many things well. I want to study data science, maths, devops and find that my desire is driven by fear of becoming outdated and irrelevant. I would appreciate a piece of advise on managing the learning process, get the joy of tinkering back and conquering the anxiety of ever changing rules to the game. Thank you.",
